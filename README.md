# CSC317-Group-Project-HTML-Storefront

This is a GROUP assignment. 

Your goal is to "code" your website design in HTML (4 or 5).  But no CSS or Javascript (yet).

I do not care about the images (have some, but they do not need to be final product).  But I do expect to see the full navigation, the home page, all product pages, and intermediate pages.  And I want you to be able to present your site (screen share) in class (see iLearn for dates).  Feedback will be given and you will have till the evening of the following day to submit your assignment.

Some things I expect in addition to the site:

**File Organization** - files should be in directories within the /var/www/html directory so as to allow easier file management.  Images should be within their own structure and product pages should be in their own directory.

**Meaningful Names** - files, thus the URL should have meaningful names to the user.

**Submission** - Should be in the assignments GitHub (all files/folders within your /var/www/html directory).  And a writeup in PDF submitted to iLearn.  The PDF should include your team name, all the members of the teams names, the github userid for the submitted assignment and a description of what you did, problems encountered and how you solved then.  (only one person in the group needs to submit)

Don't forget to be able to present your site during class!  No more than 5 minutes per group.
